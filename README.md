### Accessing rpi cmd over a browser using ttyd

ttyd is a simple command-line tool for sharing terminal over the web.

Download .arm version of ttyd binary from the following command
```
wget https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd/releases/download/1.6.3/ttyd.armhf 
```

Copy the binary to /usr/local/bin/ttyd
```
sudo cp ttyd.armhf /usr/local/bin/ttyd
```

Changing permission
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ttyd
```

Running ttyd

sudo ttyd -c username:password -p {PORT_NUMBER} bash &
```

You can now access terminal by entering http://localhost:{PORT-NUMBER} on your browser.
